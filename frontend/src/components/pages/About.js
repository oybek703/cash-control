                Cash control is a process that is used to verify the complete nature and accurate recording of all cash that is received, as well as any cash disbursements that take place. As a broad principle of responsible financial accounting, this process takes place in any environment where goods and services are bought and sold. As such, businesses, non-profit organizations and households all employ its basic tenets.
                To fully understand cash control, it is helpful to understand what is meant by cash, when it comes to financial accounting. Along with referring to currency and coin, this term is also understood to include forms of financial exchange like money orders, credit card receipts, and checks. Essentially, any type of financial exchange that can be immediately negotiated for a fixed value qualifies.
                Cash control means competently managing all these types of financial instruments by maintaining an accurate tracking system that accounts for both receiving and disbursing the cash. Designing this process is typically not difficult, and there are a few basic elements that will be incorporated into the process, regardless of whether the procedure is used in the home or in an office or business environment.
